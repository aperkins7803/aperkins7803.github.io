      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you have a dog? Do you like to post or look at dogs on social media? Do you not like cats? My plan is to make a social media specifically dedicated to pictures and videos of dogs. Some people don’t like to get into all of the small details of others’ lives, but with my project, they won’t have to. They can look at their feed to have a quick laugh or use it to post and share their dog’s cuteness. They can do this without any intrusion of cats. If this is interesting to you, you should go onto this website and invest.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is people who love dogs and are willing to spend a good amount of time looking at them or posting about them. This would most likely include teenagers at their parent's home or in college, and dog owners. Because of this, I should include a dog related theme throughout.  </p>  <!-- change this -->
